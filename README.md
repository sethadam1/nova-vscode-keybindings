# Nova VSCode Keybindings

Keybindings to make [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://nova.app) (and VSCode offshoots like [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en) and [Zed](https://zed.dev)) to behave like [Panic's Nova](https://nova.app). 

## Directions
* Open your app 
* Bring up JSON keybindings. Usually this is done with Shift+Cmd+P 
* Select Open Keyboard Shortcuts (JSON)
* Paste the content of the file keybindings.json
* Save the file
